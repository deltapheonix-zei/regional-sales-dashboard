# 📊 Regional Performance Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

This is my first self-driven data analysis project, where I built a dashboard to analyze and compare regional sales and profitability using the **Sample Superstore** dataset. The goal was to identify performance gaps and insights across Central, East, South, and West zones in the US.
